Project: mihc2ometiff

Purpose:
A set of Python command line utilities to convert the output from the Coussens Lab mIHC workflow, a directory structure of SVS files, single channel images and associated metadata, into a single standard OME-TIFF file following the BF6 pyramid scheme.

Requirements:
For convenience a bash script, mihc2ometiff.sh, wraps the Python script and does some of the file manipulation.
mihc2ometiff.py is a Python3 script requiring version 3.6. It relies on a number of standard Python libraries such as libtiff, Pandas. It uses the bundled mihcparse.py to extract ROI information from the .xml file generated by Aperio's ImageScope software.
For the actual conversion to OME-TIFF it uses the Glencoe Software bioformats2raw/raw2ometiff Java utilities described and available from: https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw and https://github.com/glencoesoftware/raw2ometiff
Install the Glencoe programs so they are in the user's execution path before running mihc2ometiff.sh

Usage:
mihc2ometiff.sh -v -p -m -s <input_dir>

where <input_dir> is the path to the directory containing the Coussens Lab file structure. Its name will be used to construct the output filename(s) as a sub-directory of the <input_dir>
Use the optional -v flag for more verbose output which is useful in debugging.
Use the optional -p flag to set the pixel spacing if different from 0.325
Use the optional -m flag to incorporate into the multi-channel output image any mask images provided
Use the optional -s flag to omit any slide label or overview images so as to avoid any PHI
