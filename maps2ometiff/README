Project: maps2ometiff

Purpose:
A Python command line utility to convert the output from the FEI MAPS program, a complex directory structure of tile images and associated metadata, into a single standard OME-TIFF file following the BF6 pyramid scheme.

Requirements:
maps2ometiff is a Python3 script requiring version 3.6. It relies on a number of standard Python libraries such as PIL, tifffile, numpy.
For the actual conversion to OME-TIFF it uses the Glencoe Software bioformats2raw/raw2ometiff Java utilities described and available from: https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw and https://github.com/glencoesoftware/raw2ometiff
Install the Glencoe programs so they are in the user's execution path before running maps2ometiff

This repo also includes batch_map2ometiff, which is a bash utility script specific to OHSU's Exacloud compute cluster controlled with SLURM, to allow batch submission of maps2ometiff jobs.

Usage:
maps2ometiff.py -v <inputfile> <outputfile>

where <inputfile> is the path to the file 'pyramid.xml' in the MAPS directory tree
and <outputfile> is the path and basename of the OME-TIFF output file. Note that ome.tif will be appended.
Use the optional -v flag for more verbose output which is useful in debugging.
